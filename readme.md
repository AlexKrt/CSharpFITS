This repo is a fork of http://vo.iucaa.ernet.in/~voi/CSharpFITS.html who unfortunately do not have a github repo of their own.

	CSharpFITS package   is a pure C# .NET port of Tom McGlynn's nom.tam.fits Java package. It provides native C# support for reading and writing FITS files.

	The CSharpFITS package  was initially ported by Samuel Carliles. The development of this new version of CSharpFITS is undertaken by VO-I.

	This package is available for download in the form of a compiled binary and its source code.The compiled binary can be directly added to your project as a reference.Source code is also available for those who are intrested and it can be viewed with anything capable of reading ASCII,but Visual Studio supporting .NET framework 2.0 (Visual Studio 2005) is required to open and compile the project.
	
This fork is modernizing the code base.  It has been updated to .net 4.0 and Visual Studio 2013.	Upgraded nUnit.
